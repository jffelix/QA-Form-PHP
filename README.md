# QA-Form-PHP
 
Welcome to my first PHP application! This project was created in order to better understand server-side rendering. The format is structured in that you sumbit basic information. After the information is logged into the database, you are then directed to the survey with questions based on my how my learning experience for PHP was. After the answers are submitted, those responses update the current user row.

## Accomplishments
- Learned XAMPP
- Learned how to implement PHP in a project setting
- Connected PHP to MySQL database
- Transferred data among different files

## Future Goals
- Create an adminView feature to view all user responses
- Use log-in verification for admin users
